## ⚡ Cache Management

**Cache Duration**: 24 hours (86400 seconds)

### If you add data and don't see it:

**Option 1**: Wait 24 hours (cache expires automatically)

**Option 2**: Restart dev server:
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

**Option 3**: Clear Redis cache manually:
```bash
# In Redis, delete the key: certifications:all
```

## 🎨 Example Certifications

Here are some example certifications you can add:

### AWS
```sql
INSERT INTO certifications (title, issuer, description, credential_url, issued_date, display_order) 
VALUES (
  'AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional',
  'Amazon Web Services',
  'Advanced certification for designing distributed systems on AWS',
  'https://aws.amazon.com/certification/verify',
  '2024-01-15',
  1
);
```

### Google Cloud
```sql
INSERT INTO certifications (title, issuer, description, credential_url, issued_date, display_order) 
VALUES (
  'Google Cloud Professional Developer',
  'Google Cloud',
  'Building scalable applications on Google Cloud Platform',
  'https://cloud.google.com/certification',
  '2023-09-20',
  2
);
```

### MongoDB
```sql
INSERT INTO certifications (title, issuer, description, credential_url, issued_date, display_order) 
VALUES (
  'MongoDB Certified Developer',
  'MongoDB University',
  'NoSQL database design and development expertise',
  'https://university.mongodb.com/certification',
  '2023-05-10',
  3
);
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No certifications showing"
✅ **Solution**: Add at least 1 certification to the database

### Issue: "Wrong color for certification"
✅ **Solution**: The color is auto-assigned based on issuer name. If it doesn't match, you can:
- Update the `getColorForCert()` function in the component
- Or it will use a default rotating color

### Issue: "Date shows as full timestamp"
✅ **Solution**: The component formats it to year only. If you see full date, check the `formatDate()` function

### Issue: "Credential link not working"
✅ **Solution**: Make sure you're using the full URL with `https://`
